# Write-up Template

### Analyze, choose, and justify the appropriate resource option for deploying the app.

*For **both** a VM or App Service solution for the CMS app:*
- *Analyze costs, scalability, availability, and workflow*
- *Choose the appropriate solution (VM or App Service) for deploying the app*
- *Justify your choice*

=> I use App Service for this project because:
    + App service easy to deploy and tracking log
    + App service cheaper than VMs
    + Do not care about hardware when using App Service

### Assess app changes that would change your decision.

*Detail how the app and any other needs would have to change for you to change your decision in the last section.*
